## Operating System and IDE

- <b>Operating System</b>: Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)

- <b>IDE</b>: VSCode and Vim

## How to run

1. `cd` into the project directory (i.e. the directory that this `README.md` file is in).

2. Run `make` to compile the `imgDisplay` and `vidDisplay` executables.

3. run `./bin/imgDisplay` to run the image display program.

4. run `./bin/vidDisplay` to run the video display program.

## Testing extensions

- Sepia filter extension:

1. run `./bin/vidDisplay`.

2. press the `e` key to toggle the sepia filter on and off.

- Video recoring extension:

- I attempted to implement a video recording feature. It did not work on my machine so it I do not expect
any credit for it. But you can attempt to run it on your machine as follows:

1. run `./bin/vidDisplay`.

2. press the `v` key to toggle the recording on and off.
